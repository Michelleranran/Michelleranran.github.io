<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently working as Boya Postdoctoral Researcher at Peking University with Prof. [Song-Chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/).
Before that, I received Ph.D in Computer Science from EECS, Peking University, supervised by Prof. [Yizhou Wang](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/wangyizhou/#../../../english/index.htm), and received B.Sc in Communication Engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University.

My current research interests are robot learning, multi-agent learning, and computer vision, particularly in building agents with physical and social common sense  <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ejDz1bYAAAAJ&hl'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
